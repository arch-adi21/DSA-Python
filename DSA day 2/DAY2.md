# Linked List

In this module we will talk about a better method to implement list function . It's called linked list. Basically in lists , you use indexing to traverse the arrays , but in linked list you use links to traverse the array. It's just like following railway compartments.

as you can check in the image that a s ingle data element is called `head` . It contains information or the value of the data of current head and a pointer to the location of the next head. Same goes for the next head. The pointer location in the last head is genrally empty.
